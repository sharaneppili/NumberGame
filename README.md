A fun, interactive browser-based game that **guesses the number you're thinking of between 1 and 30** using simple binary logic and timed yes/no inputs. No magic, just math!

## 📝 Brief Description

This project is a web-based number guessing game that uses the principles of **binary representation** to "read your mind." When you think of a number between 1 and 30, the game displays a sequence of number sets and asks whether your number is present in each one. By recording your yes/no responses over five rounds, it reconstructs your number through bitwise logic.

This game is designed with:
- A **clean and colorful UI**
- A **countdown timer** for each question
- **Interactive elements** that reveal the final guessed number

It's a great project for learning JavaScript timing functions, DOM manipulation, binary math, and basic UI design using HTML/CSS.
